# web design copy right

Copyright laws protect creative and intellectual property from those who would steal it.

- The right to a creative work exists automatically from the moment of creation.
- Copyright gives the holder the exclusive rights to use, copy, transmit or modify their original content.
- There is no need for the author, artist, or developer to publish or register their work.

You may have noticed the ‘all rights reserved’ or ‘copyright’ text in a website’s footer. This copyright notice prohibits others from duplicating the images, text, or other creative elements on the site. It also protects the source code.

## copyright vs registered copyright in Canada

a copyrightable work is protected by copyright laws the moment it is created and fixed in a material form. Registering your work with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office is voluntary, but can be beneficial.
First, if you have to enforce your copyright in a lawsuit against an alleged infringer, the copyright registration may be used as evidence against the infringing party that pleads "innocent infringement." An "innocent infringer" can argue in court that they were unaware of any copyrights in the infringed work due to the lack of registration. The courts will generally award lesser penalties if indeed the infringer is found to be an "innocent infringer."
Second, a registration can be produced in the court as evidence to support that copyright exists and that the registrant is the owner of the work.

To sum up the legalities of copying a website design:

- You cannot duplicate copyrighted elements such as images, text, or source code.
- It is illegal to use someone’s logo or trademarked material.
- You can gather inspiration from a number of sites and incorporate them into your web design.
- It is legal to recreate elements similar to those on another site using custom code.
- Using a website template means there will be thousands of other sites similar to yours and you have no rights to the source code.
- A custom website gives you ownership of your unique design, and another site cannot legally copy it.
